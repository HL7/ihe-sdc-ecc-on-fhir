<!--## Terminology-->
Each question and answer pair should be represented in a ValueSet. In the ValueSet, the code and the display value should be the unique identifier and title of the element should be capture from the SDC form.

These codes and titles in the ValueSet are mapped to standardized terminologies (e.g. SNOMED-CT) using a ConceptMap Resource. Data extraction and mapping can then be aided through the use of these codes.
